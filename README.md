# FNaF Menu Loader (FML)

This is the third version of FML.  
Now as a mod rather than an external exe with no additional useless / broken features.  
Press F7 in-game and the menu will open. You can also press F5 to toggle flight mode.  

This repo also contains the latest SDK (as of 08/03/2023) for FNaF: Security Breach + the Ruin DLC.

The packaged pak is available in the [Skizzium Launcher](https://github.com/Skizzium/Skizzium/releases/latest/download/SkizziumLauncher-Setup.exe)
) and will soon be available on [Skizzium Mods](https://skizzium.com/).
